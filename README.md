# Solution for Leetcode problem: 146. LRU Cache

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

My solution for the above leetcode problem implemented a doubly linked list along with a map of key/node pairs to achieve an average run time complexity of O(1) for both the Get and Put functions.

There is mainly edge case if statements which if I spent more time I could maybe attempt to avoid or remove. For now this is my minimal viable solution.
